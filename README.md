# Management_of_customer_card_records_in_a_supermarket

Simple application of various features in Excel VBA.

This project was developed in a course of Excel VBA and Macros and it consists on the managment of client card registry of a supermarket.
The goal was to create a form to manage the clients information and to do so I created a form in which the user can save ("Guardar"), search ("Pesquisar") and remove ("Remover") clients and to improve usability the clean ("Limpar") and close ("Fechar") buttons were also created.

The code is commented for better understanding :)
